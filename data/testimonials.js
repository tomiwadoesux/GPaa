      "I grew up listening & learning from Pastor since the age of 4 or 5 from what I can remember. The church actually started in our garage back in the late 90s early 2000’s and eventually moved to an office building that they bought out, if my memory serves me right. He was always genuinely kind and had a big heart for others. He knew everyone by name, including all the kids in the church.\n\nAs I got older and would listen to his sermons, I would always soak in the teachings and do my best to apply them in my life. I liked when he would throw in a couple jokes here and there too, because watching him crack up and have fun on stage was always so funny! Eventually, it got to a point where I learned so much from his teachings and the teachings from the youth class, that I too was asked to speak on a Youth Sunday & to give a sermon. I remember when I finished my sermon, pastor said “Wow, these are the powerful children of the Lord who will be the next generation.”\n\nPastor is truly a light!",

      "You Have a Cup! A Gratitude Perspective…\n\nIt has been a long week last week. We spent several days saying goodbye to a pastor who has been as an earthly father to me. And for someone who grew up without a presence an earthly father that says a lot, and last week felt like a great personal loss. Probably, no other man has done more for my immigrant family to help us stay in this wonderful country than Ps. Bayo Adeku. Not only has he paid for my husband’s and my wedding reception, but he has helped our family with maintaining our legal status on R-visa (those who know know 😊), provided us with employment, helped us in numerous practical ways for years. The things he has done for us are just countless. However, as was repeatedly stated by hundreds who attended Ps. Bayo’s wake keeping and funeral ceremonies, he was a man who helped numerous individuals and organizations. We were just one example of his boundless generosity.\n\nEveryone who knew Ps. Bayo, including myself, would tell you tha",

      "My Professor! That’s how we addressed each other. Pastor Adeku was brilliant, full of wisdom, relatable, humble, a man of God who loved his family and impacted many lives. During his sickness, he still focused less on himself and remembered people. Few days before God took him home to rest, we had the privilege to visit him and he asked “How is Funmi”? That was so touching to me. You have finished your own race gallantly and did not deny your faith. Adieu, my Professor!",
